# Arduino Library Examples

In this directory you will find some useful codes to implement with your WidowX Robot Arm right away. Take a look to how they work and modify them to suit your needs!

## Test Arm

The `testArm.ino` file is ideal to check if the installation was done properly. Just load it into your ArbotiX and watch the arm move from rest, to home, to center and back to rest. Also, check the Serial Monitor to observe some useful messages, like the operation voltage of the arm.
