In here you will find a Matlab livescript that details the calculations of the forward kinematics and the multiple inverse kinematics
that are used in the library. If you have the chance, take a look at it and play around with the simulations of the kinematics 
implemented with [Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox](https://la.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68542-robotics-toolbox-for-matlab)
